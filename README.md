# Game-Bots
So this one is a series of bots that I am attempting to make to play games for me on my android phone. The first bot is for a game called Orna, its a real world MMORPG. I am going to have the bot farm for exp and complete quests and maybe some other basic functions. 
Next bot is going to be for clash of clans, not much to do here other than scroll thru enemys that have weak defenses (going to use pixel values to determine if your bot should attack or not.) and upgrade stuff right after stuff is done upgrading. 
The third bot is going to be for Pokemon Go, and the Forth will be for Pokemon Planet.


Also if you want to use any of these bots, You will need to download and install adb-platform-tools and scrcpy!
